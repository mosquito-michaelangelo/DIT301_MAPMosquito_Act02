## What did you observe about the app lifecycle when switching between screens or minimizing the app?
When I made the app with two screens, I saw that when I moved from Screen 1 to Screen 2, the first screen 
stopped for a while and the next one started. When I minimized the app and opened it again, it went back to 
where I was, but it lagged a lot. I learned that Android handles what happens when I change screens or leave 
the app automatically. I didn’t see much of the process clearly because Android Studio was lagging while I 
was testing the app.


## What did you learn about activity management in Android?
I learned that each screen in Android Studio is called an Activity, and they all have their own lifecycles.
At first, it was confusing, but now I understand that I need to manage each activity properly so the app
doesn’t crash or lose data.
